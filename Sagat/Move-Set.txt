==================

= TIGER RAGE =

Tiger Rage is Sagat's install super. Upon activating it, he has many different modifications to his moves.
This is a complete list of those modifications:

-Tiger Shot causes the opponent to go straight up, allowing for juggling
-Tiger Uppercut becomes the EX Tiger Uppercut, and can juggle into other moves
-Tiger Knee becomes the Double Tiger Knee, and can juggle into other moves
-Tiger Rush causes more damage'
-Tiger Bait causes a wall bounce
-No EX moves
-You can get a free level 1 super during Tiger Rage, but using it ends the Rage altogether
-Sagat causes more damage overall
-Sagat walks faster

Move: Tiger Rage
Description: Sagat activates Tiger Rage.
Command: D, DF, F, D, DF, F, Start
Meter Cost: 1
PROPERTIES
-Install Super
-Activates Rage Mode
==================

= OLD SAGAT =

Old Sagat is Sagat's EX mode. The name gives you all that you need to know in terms of what Old Sagat
can do. He plays exactly like his appearance from Street Fighter II. While Sagat's movelist is shortened
down, the existing moves that are kept are insanely good. Here's a list of what changed in Old Sagat:

-Tiger Shots go much slower in LP version, and go much faster in HP version.
-Tiger Uppercut causes more damage
-Tiger Knee causes more damage
-No EX Moves
-No Supers, No Custom Combo, No Power Up
-Tiger Rush and Tiger Bait are removed
-Sagat's normals cause a lot more damage
-Sagat's stun damage is heavily increased
-Sagat's voice changes to his SFII one.

In terms of who is better between normal and Old Sagat, it's uncertain. While Normal Sagat has access to all of
his tools, Old Sagat's much more abridged move-set is much more dangerous. It's a dead even match, and I don't
really know which one is the better of the two.
